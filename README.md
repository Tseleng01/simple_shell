# Simple Shell Project

## Overview

The Simple Shell project, successfully implemented by the collaborative efforts of Peter Otakhor and Mbali Dikgale, is a UNIX command-line interpreter designed to provide users with a basic shell environment. This project explores fundamental concepts in programming, C language basics, and the essentials of creating a functional shell.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Shell:** The Simple Shell displays a user-friendly prompt, awaiting commands from the user. The prompt reappears after each command execution.

- **Command Execution:** The shell processes simple command lines, with each line ending in a newline character. It executes commands and displays any output produced.

- **Error Handling:** Robust error-handling mechanisms have been implemented. If an executable cannot be found, an appropriate error message is displayed, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **End-of-File Handling:** The shell gracefully handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D), allowing users to exit the shell seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout the project, Peter Otakhor and Mbali Dikgale mastered several key learning objectives:

- Understanding the basics of programming and the C language.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills through the creation of a command-line interpreter.
- Collaboration and teamwork, as the project was a joint effort between the two developers.
- Learning to create and maintain a collaborative codebase adhering to specific guidelines and principles.

## Implementation Details

The shell project is divided into multiple tasks, covering aspects such as handling command lines with arguments, implementing built-in commands like exit and env, and managing environmental variables. Each task builds upon the previous, progressively adding complexity to the shell.
